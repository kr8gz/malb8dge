# Making a guessing game
Now let's create something more advanced! A classic beginner project is a simple guessing game.
Here is a list of instructions we want it to execute:

* A secret random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
* The program will repeatedly ask for the player's guess.
* A message will be printed that states whether the guess was too high or too low.
* If the guess is equal to the secret number, a message appears telling the player that they won and the program will stop.

Let's start with the first task - the next chapter will introduce malb8dge's operators and teach you how to generate a random number using one of them.
