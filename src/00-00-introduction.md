# Introduction
malb8dge is a very high-level and dynamically-typed esolang that aims to shorten code by removing words and reducing repetitions wherever possible, while still keeping it somewhat easy to write and understand.
If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, you still have about 2 chapters left to decide whether you want to stay or not.
