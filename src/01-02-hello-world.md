# Hello, world!
Now that you've successfully installed malb8dge, create a file called *hello.mlb8* with the following contents:
```
;"Hello, world!"
```

To run this program, simply type `malb8dge hello` in your favorite terminal.
If `Hello, world!` was printed to your console, then congratulations! You have written your first malb8dge program!

> **Note:** `malb8dge <file>` isn't the only way to run malb8dge - an interactive shell also exists, which can be started by typing `malb8dge` without any arguments!

Now let's break down this program to understand what exactly is happening:

* `;` is an operator (more on that [later](02-01-rng-using-operators.md#introducing-malbd8ges-operators)) that prints everything that comes after it to the console.
* `"Hello, world!"` is a string, which you probably already know from other programming languages.
  (If you have no programming experience, I strongly recommend immediately finding another activity to waste your precious time on.)

Great! It will almost certainly only go downhill from here on.
